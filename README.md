In this repository, I have built 6 machine learning models with the dataset herbeby uploaded as well. A visual comparison between each model is also shown along with.

The models built are:

1. Decision Tree Regression

2. Random Forest with Mean Absolute Error criterion

3. Random Forest with Mean Square Error criterion

4. Support Vector Regression with RBF kernel

5. Support Vector Regression with Sigmoid kernel

6. Support Vector Regression with Linear kernel

All the models are compared on various metrics (6 to be exact).
